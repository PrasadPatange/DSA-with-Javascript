   1) ALGORITHM COMPLEXITY :-
      1) Algorithm Basics
      2) What is Algorithm Complexity

        (1) Time Complexity :
           -> The Time Complexity is mainly calculated by counting the number of steps to finish the exection.

         (2) Space Complexity :
           -> Space Complexity is the amount of space required to solve a problem.
           -> Space Complexity = Auxiliary space + Input Size.
           
         (3) Big O notation : Use to denote Complexity(both).
