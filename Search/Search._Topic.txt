Important for Front End Developer : Searching,sorting,array
1) Search Algorithm in DA :-
   1) What is search and search Algorithm.
   2) Understand Linear search.
   3) The Complexity of linear search.
     -> time Complexity => f(n) n = input
     -> Linear Search Complexity = f(n) = O(n)  (because it use single for loop)
   4) Implement linear algorithm.
   5) Implement linear algorithm with inputs also.
