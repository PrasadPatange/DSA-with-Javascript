1) Array Traversing and Accessing :-
   -> Make HTML Page with Basic Array.
   -> Traversing with Loop.
   -> Accessing Elements.
   -> Access element with text input and button.
   -> Validation.

2) Insert Element in Array :-
   -> Make Array, define the position.
   -> Use Loop to insert new Element.
   -> Insert Element with text input and button.
   -> Insert Element with bydefault function Ex:- splice()

3) Delete Element in Array :-
   -> Make Array, define the position.
   -> Use Loop to delete new Element.
   -> Delete Element with text input and button.
   -> Delete Element with bydefault function Ex:- splice()

4) Search Element in Array (Basic Linear) :-
   -> Make Array, define the SearchItem.
   -> Use Loop to Search new Element.
   -> Search Element with text input and button.
   -> Search Element with bydefault function Ex:- indexOf()

5) Merge Two Array :-
   -> Make Three Arrays.
   -> Use 2 Different Loop to Merge Element.
   -> Shortcut for Merge Array(Default Function)
   -> Shortcut for Reverse Array Element(Default Function)

6) Merge Two Array (While Loop) :-
   -> Make Three Arrays.
   -> Use While Loop to Merge Element.

   -> Compare this Logic with Last one.
      -> 1) Space Complexity = memory (less)
      -> 2) Time Complexity  = number of lines (less)

      comapare : 
     * A) Merge Two Array(for loop) :
          1) Time Complexity : 
             10 lines + loops iterate array 6+4 = 10 total = 20 Lines
          2) Space Complexity :
            variables data1,data2,MergeArr,i ----- 4 memory space

     * B) Merge Two Array(while loop) :
         1) Time Complexity : 
            22 lines + loops iterate array 6+4 = 10 total = 32 Lines
         2) Space Complexity :
            variables data1,data2,data3,d1,d2,d3 ----- 6

   * As compare to A and B for loop best for space and time Complexity in case
     of normal array Merge
   * But if we want to merge and sort array then B i.e using While loop is better than A.

7) Array Sorting ( Bubble Sort ) :-
     1) Basic Understanding
     2) Write Code and Understand step by step
